# Bank-Account-Manager
Uses Python to manage any number of bank accounts
python version 2.7

This is a command line program that uses the file accounts.txt to store a dictionary of accounts.  The program allows the user to log into their account and make changes or delete their account if they choose.  Only one account can be active at a time.  In the future, I plan to add passwords so that every account needs a password to be accessed.  I may use a separate file containing a python list or store everything in JSON
